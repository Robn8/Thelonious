    { id: '1', title: 'Diatonic Chords',
    description: `Diatonic chords are a fundamental concept that helps us understand and analyze the harmony within a musical key. Diatonic chords are built exclusively from the notes of a particular major or minor scale. In a major scale, there are seven unique notes, and each note can form a chord by stacking two or more notes on top of it.These chords are named after the scale degree from which they are constructed. For example, in the key of C major, the C major scale consists of the notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.
    Using these notes, we can build seven diatonic chords:
    
    I (Tonic): The first note of the scale (C in the key of C major) forms the I chord, which is the tonic or the home chord of the key. It's often the most stable and restful chord.

ii (Supertonic): The second note (D in the key of C major) forms the ii chord, known as the supertonic. It's a chord with a sense of motion, often leading to the dominant (V) chord.

iii (Mediant): The third note (E in the key of C major) forms the iii chord, known as the mediant. It has a somewhat neutral and smooth character.

IV (Subdominant): The fourth note (F in the key of C major) forms the IV chord, known as the subdominant. It provides a sense of departure from the tonic and often creates a gentle contrast.

V (Dominant): The fifth note (G in the key of C major) forms the V chord, known as the dominant. It's a powerful and tension-building chord that often leads back to the tonic (I) chord.

vi (Submediant): The sixth note (A in the key of C major) forms the vi chord, known as the submediant. It has a pleasing and comforting quality.

vii° (Leading Tone): The seventh note (B in the key of C major) forms the vii° chord, known as the leading tone or diminished chord. It creates a strong pull back to the tonic (I) chord.` },
    
{ id: '2', title: 'Major Triads',
     description: `In music theory, a major triad is a fundamental and widely used chord consisting of three notes. These notes are the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth of a major scale. Major triads have a bright and uplifting sound, making them an essential building block in creating happy and optimistic melodies and harmonies.

     Let's break down the components of a major triad:
     
     Root: The root is the foundational note of the chord. It gives the chord its name and establishes its tonal center. For example, in a C major triad, the root is C.
     
     Major Third: The major third is an interval that spans four half steps (or two whole steps) above the root. It contributes to the chord's major quality. In a C major triad, the major third is E.
     
     Perfect Fifth: The perfect fifth is an interval that spans seven half steps (or three and a half whole steps) above the root. It adds stability and balance to the chord. In a C major triad, the perfect fifth is G.
     
     Putting it all together, a C major triad consists of the notes C, E, and G.
     
     Visually, a major triad can be represented as a triangle, with the root at the bottom, the major third on the left, and the perfect fifth on the right. The combination of these three notes creates a consonant and pleasing sound.
     
     In music notation, a major triad is typically written with the chord's root note followed by the letter "maj." For example, C major triad is written as "Cmaj."
     
     Major triads are the basis of many songs and musical compositions in various genres. Understanding and identifying major triads is crucial for musicians, composers, and songwriters as they create harmonies, progressions, and melodies that evoke feelings of happiness and brightness.` },
    
     { id: '3', title: 'Dominant Chords',
      description: `In music theory, the dominant note refers to the fifth scale degree of a given key or scale. It plays a crucial role in establishing tension and resolving harmony within a piece of music. The dominant note is often denoted by the Roman numeral "V" when analyzing chord progressions.

      Here's a breakdown of the dominant note:
      
      Fifth Scale Degree: In a major or minor scale, the dominant note is the note that is five scale degrees above the tonic (the first note of the scale). For example, in the key of C major, the dominant note is G, as it is the fifth note (C-D-E-F-G) of the C major scale.
      
      Tension and Resolution: The dominant note has a strong pull or tendency to resolve back to the tonic note. This phenomenon is known as "tonic-dominant relationship" and is a fundamental aspect of Western music harmony. The dominant creates a sense of tension and anticipation, which is resolved when it moves back to the tonic.
      
      Dominant Chord: The dominant note is also associated with the dominant chord, which is a major chord built on the fifth scale degree of the key. In C major, the dominant chord is G major (G-B-D). The dominant chord is essential in establishing cadences, which are musical phrases that provide a sense of conclusion to a musical phrase or section.
      
      Importance in Chord Progressions: Dominant chords often lead to the tonic chord (the "I" chord) in chord progressions, creating a feeling of resolution and stability. The dominant-tonic relationship is a cornerstone of many chord progressions found in various styles of music.
      
      Understanding the dominant note and its relationship to the tonic is vital for composers, songwriters, and musicians. Utilizing the tension and resolution created by the dominant note allows them to craft captivating and emotionally engaging musical passages, creating a sense of motion and direction in their compositions.` },
    
     { id: '4', title: 'Relative Minor',
      description: `In music theory, a relative minor is a concept that relates to major scales. Every major scale has a corresponding relative minor scale that shares the same key signature. The relative minor is found by starting on the sixth scale degree of the major scale.

      Here's a breakdown of the relative minor:
      
      Finding the Relative Minor: To find the relative minor of a major scale, you can count six notes up from the tonic (the first note) of the major scale. For example, in the key of C major, the sixth note is A, so A minor is the relative minor of C major.
      
      Shared Key Signature: The major scale and its relative minor have the same key signature, meaning they use the same sharps or flats. For instance, C major has no sharps or flats, and its relative minor, A minor, also has no sharps or flats.
      
      Emotional Contrast: Relative minors provide an emotional contrast to their corresponding major keys. Major keys often have a bright and happy quality, while their relative minors tend to have a more subdued, melancholic, or introspective feel.
      
      Chord Progressions: The relative minor is frequently used in chord progressions. It can be used to add emotional depth and variety to a piece of music. For example, a song in C major might transition to the relative minor, A minor, for a more contemplative or emotional section before returning to the major key.
      
      Parallel Major and Minor: It's important to differentiate between relative minor and parallel minor. A parallel minor shares the same tonic as the major key but has a different key signature. For example, the parallel minor of C major is C minor, which has three flats (Bb, Eb, Ab).
      
      Understanding relative minors is valuable in music composition, improvisation, and analysis. It allows musicians to explore the emotional range of a key and create more nuanced and expressive musical compositions.` },
